    <h1>My Best Friend</h1>
    <p>
      Meet Scraps. Here he is posting pictures of his recent trip to the park.
      In October, Scraps turned the big zero three, which is 21 in human years.
      Look out, doggie distilleries! Move your mouse over his picture to see him
      at his birthday bash.
